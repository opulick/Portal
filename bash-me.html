<h1>Olivia Pulick Bash</h1>
</header>
<p>
I am Olivia Pulick, a senior student at CU Boulder. My major is Technology, Arts and Media Engineering. During the winter season I like to ski/snowboard with friends and family.My favorite spot to go skiing is at Vail. The only experience I have with web technologies is I took the Web class from ATLS. I am interested in learning how to make a website more interactive. I would also like to better my skills in flexbox.
